    title: OSS Contributions
    intro: |
      During my time at the Institute of Automatic Control, I have advocated for more open source to improve the reproducibility of our research.
      I specifically consider [(development) containers](https://github.com/rwth-irt/ros2-devcontainer) useful for simplified reproducibility.
      Please look at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/tuebel) for the most recent contributions.
